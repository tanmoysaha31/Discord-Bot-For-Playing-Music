## 🚀 About This "Masterpiece"

Congratulations! You’ve stumbled upon *yet another* Discord music bot. But wait – this isn't just *any* music bot. This is **your soon-to-be favorite DJ** (or your worst nightmare, depending on how much you break it). 🎧

This bot allows you to stream "high-quality" audio from YouTube, create a queue, and **pretend you're running a professional radio station** in your Discord server. Best part? It comes with completely *unnecessary* but *totally essential* volume control. 🤩

## 🎛 Features That Will "Change Your Life"

✅ **Queue System** – Because chaos isn't always fun. Add and remove songs like a pro.  
✅ **Auto-Play Next** – No more awkward silences! (unless you stop it)  
✅ **Volume Control** – For when Karen says "IT'S TOO LOUD!!1!" 🔇  
✅ **Pause & Resume** – Take a break from the *absolute bangers* whenever you want.  
✅ **Stop & Disconnect** – Make the bot leave when you're done flexing your playlist.  
✅ **YouTube Streaming** – Now with 20% more copyright violations!  
✅ **FFmpeg Magic** – The only reason this bot actually works.

## 🧠 Pro Tips (a.k.a. "Why Is It Not Working?!")

- **FFmpeg** is required. Here's how to install it:  
  ```sh
  # For Linux
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg -y  # Pray your package manager works

  # For Windows
  # Good luck :)
  ```

- The bot needs these permissions:  
  ```
  [✅] View Channels  
  [✅] Connect  
  [✅] Speak  
  [❌] Admin (nice try)  
  ```

- If you get `RuntimeError: Event loop closed`, just pretend it didn't happen.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting (a.k.a. Panic Mode)

| "FFmpeg not found" | Read the Pro Tips (I wrote them for a reason) |
| Audio sounds like a dying robot | Blame YouTube. Always blame YouTube. |
| Bot plays Nickelback on repeat | Congratulations, you've found the Easter egg! |
