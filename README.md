## 🚀 About This Masterpiece

Congratulations! You’ve stumbled upon *yet another* Discord music bot. But wait – this isn't just *any* music bot. This is **your soon-to-be favorite DJ** (or your worst nightmare, depending on how much you break it). 🎧

This bot allows you to stream high-quality audio from YouTube, create a queue, and **pretend you're running a professional radio station** in your Discord server. Best part? It comes with completely *unnecessary* but *totally essential* volume control. 🤩

## 🎛 Features That Will Change Your Life (or Not)

✅ **Queue System** – Because chaos isn't always fun. Add and remove songs like a pro.  
✅ **Auto-Play Next** – No more awkward silences! (unless you stop it)  
✅ **Volume Control** – Increase or decrease the volume when someone inevitably complains.  
✅ **Pause & Resume** – Take a break from the *absolute bangers* whenever you want.  
✅ **Stop & Disconnect** – Make the bot leave when you're done flexing your playlist.  
✅ **YouTube Streaming** – Supports *bestaudio* (because we have *standards*).  
✅ **FFmpeg Magic** – So it actually plays music instead of staring at you blankly.

## 📜 Commands You Might Actually Use

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `?addtolist <URL>` | Adds a song to the queue. Simple, right? |
| `?play <URL>` | Clears the queue (mercilessly) and plays a new song. |
| `?playnext` | Skips the current song like a true music dictator. |
| `?removesong` | Removes the *first* song from the queue (because democracy). |
| `?volumeup` | Increases volume. Careful, your ears exist. |
| `?volumedown` | Lowers the volume in case of bad taste. |
| `?pause` | Pauses the song for dramatic effect. |
| `?resume` | Unpauses when the drama is over. |
| `?stop` | Kicks the bot out. Rude, but fair. |

## 🧠 Pro Tips (a.k.a. Things You Will Google Anyway)

- Make sure you have **FFmpeg** installed. No, it won’t install itself.  
- The bot needs **permission to join and speak** in a voice channel. Give it power.  
- If YouTube suddenly blocks audio, blame YouTube, not me.
